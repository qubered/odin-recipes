### Self Reflection
Although coming into this project I was already familiar with basic HTML, the repetitiveness got me more comfortable using lists in HTML. Likewise repeating the setup of the Boilerplate HTML got me comfortable creating the foundation of HTML files

I found this project beneficial in enforcing the use of alt in images. I did not understand the importance before The Odin Project.

Similarly, this project made me more comfortable using Git, I tried to do atomic commits and wrote commit messages as taught in The Odin Project.
